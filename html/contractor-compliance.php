                    <p>The Contractor Compliance Course is specifically designed to assist Paramedics and Advanced Emergency Medical Technicians (AEMTs) who are contractors on Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of State (DoS) contracts to maintain contract compliance. This course primarily focuses on equipping medics with the new TCCC-CMC Tier 3 certification and, when required in the future, the TCCC-Paramedic Tier 4 certification.</p>
                    <p>Maintaining your certification while deployed can be challenging, with courses often unavailable when needed most. The Contractor Compliance Course aims to address this issue by providing a comprehensive and accessible training solution.

The primary online component is the Tactical Austere Medical Practitioner (TAM-P) Course, followed by a 5-day in-person session to cover all required skills. This hybrid approach ensures comprehensive training and convenience for contractors.</p>
