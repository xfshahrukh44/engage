                                        <p>We all need health care and often help paying for it. A good health insurance
                                             plan can help you prioritize your health without paying more than you
                                             should and to be prepared for both preventative care and the unexpected.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>The primary purpose of health insurance is to provide financial protection
                                             against the high costs of medical care and access to great networks of
                                             providers. This helps you to access necessary medical care without worrying
                                             about the financial implications especially when faced with serious illness
                                             or injury.
                                             Health insurance can be obtained through various sources, including
                                             employers, government programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid), private
                                             insurance companies, or through healthcare marketplace exchanges.</p>
                                        <p>Engage Health Insurance LLC is here to help you make an informed decision on
                                             your health insurance and to match you up with the best plan for your
                                             needs. We work with multiple trusted health insurance carriers for unbiased
                                             recommendations tailored to your unique circumstances. </p>

                                        <p><span>Health Management Networks:</span> Depending on how many plans are offered in your area, you may find several network types such as, HMO, PPO, EPO, and POS, at each metal level—Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. </p>

                                        <p><span>Short-Term Medical Insurance:</span>These plans are designed to help
                                             with gaps in insurance coverage such as those created when you leave one
                                             job and take another before you can enroll in the new plan. These plans can
                                             run from 1 to 12 months and can be a prudent precaution.
                                        </p>
                                        <p><span>Hospital Indemnity:</span>Hospital indemnity insurance is an insurance
                                             plan you can purchase in addition to your health insurance plan. You will
                                             have a monthly premium as you would with other insurance. Should you end up
                                             spending time in the hospital, you receive a fixed benefit amount paid
                                             directly to you to help cover expenses. These plans are supplemental to
                                             health insurance for hospitalization and do not replace your health
                                             insurance.
                                        </p>
                                        <p><span>Accident Expense Insurance:</span> These plans are ancillary health
                                             plans which can be combined with your primary coverage that will pay a cash
                                             benefit in the event of an accidental injury or sickness. They may pay a
                                             lump sum for the ambulance, emergency room, hospital, doctors,
                                             rehabilitation, nursing, or prescriptions which are the result of the
                                             accident. Often accident plans do not have a requirement to stay in-network
