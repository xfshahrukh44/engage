                                   <p><span>Step 1 involves acquiring a DUNS Number promptly. If you call
                                             1-866-705-5711, you can obtain your DUNS Number immediately over the phone.
                                             However, if your organization doesn't possess one, you'll need to visit the
                                             Dun & Bradstreet website at </span><a href="#">
                                             http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform</a> to secure this unique nine-character
                                        identifier provided by Dun & Bradstreet (D&B).</p>

                                   <p><span>Step 2 pertains to registering with SAM (System for Award Management), a
                                             process that typically takes three to five business days or, at times, up
                                             to two weeks. If you already possess a Tax Identification Number, your SAM
                                             registration will likely be processed within 3-5 business days. It's
                                             essential to ensure your organization is registered with SAM by visiting
                                        </span><a href="#">
                                             www.sam.gov</a>.</p>

                              <li>
                                   <p><span>Step 3 involves promptly obtaining a Grants.gov Username and Password. By
                                             completing your Authorized Organization Representative (AOR) profile on
                                             Grants.gov, you can create your credentials the same day. It's crucial to
                                             utilize your organization's DUNS Number during this step, which can be
                                             completed at </span><a href="#">
                                             https://apply07.grants.gov/apply/OrcRegister</a>.</p>
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                   <p><span>Step 4 focuses on AOR Authorization, which can also be accomplished on the
                                             same day. The E-Business Point of Contact (E-Biz POC) within your
                                             organization needs to log in to Grants.gov to confirm you as an Authorized
                                             Organization Representative (AOR). It's worth noting that an organization
                                             may have more than one AOR, and in some instances, the E-Biz POC may serve
                                             as both the AOR and the contact point for electronic business
                                             matters.</span></p>
