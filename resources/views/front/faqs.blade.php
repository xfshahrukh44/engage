                                        <p>Our Tactical Medicine Training is structured as a four-day comprehensive course
                                             intended to be fully completed. Due to the limited number of available seats, we
                                             highly discourage missing any portion of the training. However, we recognize the
                                             constraints of organizational duty time and are willing to make adjustments
                                             accordingly, per your Training Officerâ€™s approval. It's crucial to participate
                                             in the entire curriculum to comprehend its breadth and depth thoroughly, and we
                                             are flexible in accommodating your scheduling needs.</p>

                                             start date, no refund will be issued, and your tuition will be carried over to
