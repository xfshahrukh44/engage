The ACA was intended to extend health coverage to millions of people more affordably than ever before, offering better benefits and lowering costs. Access was expanded through the creation of government health insurance marketplace exchanges where plans can be selected and compared.  ACA plans are now offered through federal and some state health insurance exchanges for enrollment during an annual Open Enrollment Period or a Special Enrollment Period thereafter with qualified life event changes.</p>

                                                  <h3>Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) Plans</h3>
                                                  <p>With a PPO, most healthcare is provided by a network of providers who are partnered with the plan and offer a substantial discount off their normal rates. Members can also receive service from providers outside of the network for a higher out-of-pocket cost. The major advantages of a PPO are flexibility and choice; for example, with a PPO you can get specialist visits covered without a referral from your primary care doctor.</p>
     
                                                  <h3>Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Plans</h3>
     
                                                  <p>HMOs are a lower cost alternative to PPOs, offering less flexibility but also lower premiums. Unlike a PPO, HMO members must receive care from doctors, specialists and hospitals that are within the HMO’s network. It generally won’t cover out-of-network care except in an emergency. An HMO may require that you live or work in its service area to be eligible for coverage. With an HMO, you select a primary care physician, or PCP, who serves as your primary contact for all of your healthcare needs. In addition to providing general medical care, your PCP must also be consulted in order to see a specialist. HMOs provide integrated care and focus on prevention and wellness.</p>
     
                                                  <h3>Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO)</h3>
     
                                                  <p>An EPO health plan is a managed health insurance plan that requires you to see healthcare providers only within the EPO network. EPO plans won't usually pay for out-of-network care except in an emergency situation.</p>
     
                                                  <p>EPOs and HMOs are similar. The primary difference between an EPO and an HMO is that you do not typically have to have a primary care physician when you use an EPO. An EPO plan also typically has a larger network of providers than an HMO plan.</p>
     
                                                  <p>EPOs are similar to PPOs in that you don't usually have to get a referral to see a specialist. However, PPOs tend to be more flexible than EPOs and HMOs since they give you more options to go out of network.</p>
     
                                                  <h3>Point of Service (POS) Plans</h3>
     
                                                  <p>With Point of Service plans, the subscriber is given a choice of receiving in-net work care or out of network care. With in-network care the insured receives care from a particular network of doctors and hospitals which is coordinated by the PCP or primary care provider. The PCP would provide a referral to see a specialist. Out-of-network coverage comes into play when the insured sees a provider who does not participate in the network and the care is not coordinated by the PCP. The insured pays more for out-of-network care than they would within the POS network.</p>
     
                                                  <h3>Health Savings Accounts (HSA) Plans</h3>
     
                                                  <p>Health Savings Account Plans allow you to put tax-free money away to cover healthcare costs. HSA Plans must be combined with a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP), which is a plan that offers low premiums in exchange for a high deductible. HSAs and HDHPs complement each other because the income tax-free money that you put into your HSA can be used to pay for your deductible, should you ever require expensive medical care. HSAs are regulated by the IRS, and have similarities with other investment vehicles; for example, ownership can be transferred to a spouse tax-free if the account owner dies.</p>

                                                  <p>A Special Enrollment Period (SEP) provides an opportunity for individuals experiencing life changes to obtain or adjust their insurance coverage outside the regular open enrollment period. To be eligible for a Special Enrollment Period individuals must experience a qualifying life event. These events include, but are not limited to, getting married or divorced, having a baby or adopting a child, losing other health coverage (such as employer-sponsored coverage, Medicaid or losing coverage at age 26 coming off the parent’s plan), moving to a new area that affects eligibility for Marketplace coverage, gaining citizenship or experiencing certain changes in income that affect eligibility for premium tax credits or cost-sharing reductions.</p>
     
                                                  <p>The time frame for SEP enrollment is generally 60 days after the qualifying event. Some events, such as losing other coverage or gaining a dependent through birth or adoption, can trigger an SEP retroactively allowing enrollment in coverage back to the date of the qualifying event. Start dates are usually the 1st of the month following the enrollment date.</p>
     
                                                  <p>Documentation might be required to verify SEP eligibility such as a marriage or birth certificate or proof of income changes depending on the situation.</p>

If you have any changes to your household or income information, it could affect your subsidy assistance and your monthly premium amount.  Before the start of the new coverage year, the Marketplace will send you a notice explaining your current plan's renewal and any changes in costs or coverage for the upcoming year. Insurance companies may make changes to their plans each year, such as adjusting premiums, changing networks, modifying covered benefits or even not offering a re-enrollment Qualified Health Plan in the new plan year.  It's essential to review this information carefully and update in order to actively address your new needs and options for coverage.</p>
     
                                                  <p>Marketplace auto-renewals will try and effect renewal into the closest plan based on the information in the previous year’s application.

                                                  <p>Absolutely! Subsidies or Premium Tax Credits are intended to subsidize the purchase of health plans offered through federal and state health insurance exchanges. The amount of the credit is dependent upon the income you report to the Health Insurance Marketplace on your application. The subsidies are designed to help individuals who might otherwise not be able to afford the protections of having health insurance to have access to many great plans.</p>
     
                                                  <p>Premium Tax Credits and Cost-Sharing Reductions are mechanisms for financial help depending upon your particular circumstances.  An Advanced Premium Tax Credit (APTC) is a financial subsidy paid in advance by the federal government to the insurance company monthly to lower the monthly premium cost to you. If the subsidy is equal to or exceeds the plan premium, you may have $0 monthly premium result.  Because these subsidies are based on your estimated annual income for the year, it is important to have an accurate estimate and to update the system with any changes. If your estimate is too low you may have to pay back some of the subsidy help received when the IRS reconciles the tax returns. Conversely, if the estimate was too high you could receive some additional subsidy in the form of a tax credit. </p>
     
                                                  <p>Cost-sharing Reductions are discounts that lower the Maximum Out-of-Pocket that you might pay under a health insurance plan. This can include “extra savings’ on deductibles and copayments. This type of cost reduction does not have to be reconciled at the end of the year as they are discounts and not tax credits. CSR’s are a feature of the Silver plans only. </p>
