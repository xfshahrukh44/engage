                                        <p><span>The U.S. government allocates billions of dollars every year for grant
                                             funding by each of the 26 federal agencies and sub-agencies. Government
                                             agencies have great discretion in the selection of grant awardees and
                                             typically receive far more applications than can be funded. Grants allow
                                             the federal government to fund local initiatives and empower local
                                             organizations to provide public services. A grant differs from a contract
                                             used to acquire property or services for the federal governmentâ€™s direct
                                             benefit or use. Grant awards vary widely in scope and award amount, mainly
                                             due to the goals of each federal agency and directives from the President
                                             and Congress.</span>
