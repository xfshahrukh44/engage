                                             <p>We all need health care and often help paying for it. A good health insurance
                                                  plan can help you prioritize your health without paying more than you
                                                  should and to be prepared for both preventative care and the unexpected.

                                             <p>The primary purpose of health insurance is to provide financial protection
                                                  against the high costs of medical care and access to great networks of
                                                  providers. This helps you to access necessary medical care without worrying
                                                  about the financial implications especially when faced with serious illness
                                                  or injury.
                                                  Health insurance can be obtained through various sources, including
                                                  employers, government programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid), private
                                                  insurance companies, or through healthcare marketplace exchanges.</p>

                                             <p><span>Short-Term Medical Insurance:</span>These plans are designed to help
                                                  with gaps in insurance coverage such as those created when you leave one
                                                  job and take another before you can enroll in the new plan. These plans can
                                                  run from 1 to 12 months and can be a prudent precaution.

                                                  plan you can purchase in addition to your health insurance plan. You will
                                                  have a monthly premium as you would with other insurance. Should you end up
                                                  spending time in the hospital, you receive a fixed benefit amount paid
                                                  directly to you to help cover expenses. These plans are supplemental to
                                                  health insurance for hospitalization and do not replace your health

                                                  plans which can be combined with your primary coverage that will pay a cash
                                                  benefit in the event of an accidental injury or sickness. They may pay a

                                                  rehabilitation, nursing, or prescriptions which are the result of the
                                                  accident. Often accident plans do not have a requirement to stay in-network

                                             <p>The purpose of vision insurance is to assist individuals in managing the
                                                  costs associated with eye care and vision-related expenses. Vision
                                                  insurance is designed to cover services and products related to maintaining
                                                  good eye health and correcting vision problems. Having vision insurance
                                                  helps promote a preventative approach to eyecare and encouragement to
                                                  prioritize eye health.</p>
